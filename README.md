### Project Description
Scan o'Clock is a web-based project where scanning a QR code opens a live digital clock. It gives users the power to know the time â€” but only after doing something totally unnecessary like scanning a code. Fun, simple, and completely impractical.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There are clocks on your phone, laptop, wrist, microwave, and even in your soul (probably). Butâ€¦ what if you could only know the time by scanning a QR code? Thatâ€™s the life-changing inconvenience we wanted to create.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a website that shows the current time, updating every second. Then we generated a QR code that links to it. Want to know the time? Go scan it. Because thatâ€™s innovation.

*Explain what the video demonstrates*
A dramatic 5-second video where someone scans a code to see the timeâ€¦ and nothing else happens.
